# Introduction

tRPC is a library that helps you build end-to-end typesafe APIs in TypeScript. tRPC is compatible with all JavaScript frameworks and runtimes, and adapters are provided for React, Next.js, Express, Fastify, AWS Lambda, Solid, Svelte, and more.

Unlike other RPC solutions, tRPC has no build or compile steps, meaning no code generation, runtime bloat or build step. With full-stack TypeScript projects, you can directly import types from the server into the client.
